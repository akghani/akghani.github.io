abstract: "Our paper presents an innovative instrument to teach
macroeconomics at the undergraduate level. We develop a digital learning platform to present and explore some controversies at the very foundations of macroeconomic theory. For this purpose, we explicitly present two competing paradigms: the new consensus, and the post-Keynesian. Several interactive scenarios are made available where the user can control different economic policy instruments and is guided through a set of problems that require
appropriate action in the context of the different approaches."
