# Macroeconomic models for the classroom

This is a project collecting a series of simulators programmed in *R* and *Shiny* of some famous macroeconomic textbook models. I carry out this project in my spare time and my goal is to develop a proper repository of macroeconomic models for the classroom. Take a look and let me know what you think!

1) Gregory N. Mankiw, **Macroeconomics**, 7th Edition, International Edition, Palgrave Macmillan (Chapter 7)
- [Neoclassical Solow Growth Model](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/solow_growth_model/)

2) Gregory N. Mankiw, **Macroeconomics**, 7th Edition, International Edition, Palgrave Macmillan (Chapter 14)
- [A Dynamic Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/DAD_DAS/)

3) Alpanda, S., Honig, A., Woglom, G. *Modern Economy*, 2013, Vol. 4, No. 3, pp. 145-160 [doi:10.4236/me.2013.43017](https://m.scirp.org/papers/29093)
- [Extending the Textbook Dynamic AD-AS Framework](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/Alpandaetal/)

4) Carlin, W., and Soskice, D., **Macroeconomics. Institutions, Instability, and the Financial System**, Oxford University Press (Chapter 3)

PS. Some models are still under development so I ask for your patience if something doesn't work. With a little time I will fix everything!
