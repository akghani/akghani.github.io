# WIPOSIM â€“ The economic policy online simulator

*Together with Eckhard Hein, Achim Truger, Franz Prante and Till van Treeck*

Goal of WIPOSIM is to extend texts and simulations developed in the previous project MGWK. Here we focused on current challenges in economic policy in three selected areas of interest: inequalities and income distribution, fiscal policy and public debt, ecology and macroeconomics. At the following link you may find a short video introduction to the project WIPOSIM.

My contribution to the project focused mainly on the first two subject areas.

**Fiscal policy and public debt:**

:white_check_mark: In the text [*Fiscal policy and public debt*](https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course.netlify.app/) we introduce the government budget identity and derive the factors determining the evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio. We then discuss the question of debt sustainability and illustrate the role of the primary balance. To conclude, we discuss the main European fiscal rule from a critical perspective. With a series of simple applications, we simulate the concepts explained in the text.

* [Evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio under different assumptions about real growth rate, real interest rate, government deficit, and the initial value of the debt ratio](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_shiny_1/)  
* [Evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio with real growth rate, nominal interest rate, and inflation rate](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_inflation/)  
* [Sustainability boundary, sustainability area and the dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_shiny_sustainability/)   
* [Required primary balance for the debt ratio to converge towards the 60% debt target in 20 years](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_primary_balance_4/)
* [Required primary balance to bring debt to target in a predefined number of years](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_primary_balance_2/)
      
:white_check_mark: In a second text [*Fiscal policy and the debt-to-GDP ratio. A seemingly counterintuitive effect?*](https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course2.netlify.app/), using some simple "Keynesian arithmetic", we show the conditions under which fiscal policy might have a counter intuitive effect on the debt ratio.

With simplified assumption about deficit spending:

* [Deficit spending and the debt-to-GDP ratio - a seemingly counterintuitive effect? The effect in the short run](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/course2_app1/)
* [Deficit spending and the debt-to-GDP ratio - a seemingly counterintuitive effect? The effect in the long run](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/course2_app2/)

With deficit spending determined endogenously by tax revenues:

* [Deficit spending and the debt-to-GDP ratio - a seemingly counterintuitive effect? The effect in the short run](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/course2_app3/)
* [Deficit spending and the debt-to-GDP ratio - a seemingly counterintuitive effect? The effect in the long run](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/course2_app4/)

:white_check_mark: In the following application the effect of fiscal policy on the debt-to-GDP ratio can be tested in a simple stock-flow consistent (SFC) model of the closed economy. The model consists of three sectors. The households sector, the firms sector and the government sector. What is the effect of a permanent increase in the level of government spending on the debt ratio? What happens to the debt ratio when government spending grows at a constant rate?

:white_check_mark: The following dashboard allows to perform short- and long-term projections of the debt ratio for eurozone countries starting from recent values. Data are obtained from the AMECO database.

**Inequalities and income distribution:**

:white_check_mark: With our inequality simulator we aim to extend Piketty's *r>g* basic model by including three separate household groups. Households are subdivided into TOP (T), MIDDLE (M) and BOTTOM (B) households.
- The simulator can be accessed [here](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/distribution_piketty_households/)
- We recommend reading the introductory text before using the model. The text can be accessed [here](https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/forum1-15-focus4.pdf)
    
:white_check_mark: In the text [Effects of the gender wage gap in a simple post-Keynesian / Kaleckian macroeconomic model](https://wiposim-genderwagegap.netlify.app/) we introduce the effects of a gender wage gap in a simple heterodox macroeconomic model of the closed economy. The model is developed in the post-Keynesian / Kaleckian tradition.
- The introductory text with the description of the model can be accessed [here](https://wiposim-genderwagegap.netlify.app/)
- The app showing the model's goods market equilibrium with a gender wage gap can be accessed  [here](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/wiposim_gender/)
