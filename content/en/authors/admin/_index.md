Iâ€™m a passionate Research Data Analyst working at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and pharmacology. 
I transform complex datasets into transparent, reproducible insights through R-based pipelines, Quarto documentation, and SPSS analyses. 
My clear visualizations and concise reports empower both research teams and stakeholders to make data-driven decisions with confidence.
